# COVID-19 Time Series Data Analysis 

## Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 trends in the United Kingdom using publicly available data from Our World in Data. 
It includes visualizations of daily cases and deaths, 7-day moving averages, peak detection, and trend analysis.

## Data Source
Data is sourced from Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset, which compiles confirmed cases and deaths globally:
[Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data)

## Methods
- Filtered dataset for the UK
- Converted dates and set time-series index
- Plotted daily cases/deaths and 7-day moving averages
- Identified peaks and calculated summary statistics
- Optional: weekly percent change to highlight trends

## Key Insights
- Multiple waves visible over time with corresponding peaks
- Moving averages smooth daily fluctuations
- Weekly percent changes highlight periods of rapid spread or decline

## Tools
Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (Google Colab)

## Limitations
- Reporting inconsistencies over time may affect trends
- Analysis is descriptive; no predictive modeling included
- Only UK data analyzed, not cross-country comparisons
